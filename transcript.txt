1.16: - [Jared] This is the Enigma machine.
3.3: It looks like a typewriter but it has
5.16: a very different purpose.
7.18: During World War II it was
used to keep messages secret
9.965: or in other words encrypted.
12.371: In this video, we'll look at
why the Enigma machine exists,
17.16: how it was used and then we'll
take a look at the inside
19.45: to see how the mechanism works.
22.104: (electricity buzzes)
28.23: This video is sponsored by Brilliant,
30.43: a fun and interactive way
to learn math and science.
33.65: Towards the end of this video
34.82: we'll take a closer look
at their website and app.
39.02: While making this video
I had a lot of help
41.01: from enigmamuseum.com.
43.29: These guys took a part
in actual enigma machine
45.517: and showed me what's on the inside,
47.93: behind the panels, all the inside wiring
50.51: and how each mechanical piece works.
53.1: This would have taken a
lot longer to 3D model
55.29: and animate without their help.
57.33: So big thanks to enigmamuseum.com
59.379: and now let's get to some animation.
62.08: To really understand the Enigma machine
63.806: we need to understand
something called encryption.
66.809: Let's use an example.
68.77: Say we have two friends, Alice and Bob.
71.49: Alice wants to send a message to Bob
73.5: however, Alice doesn't want anyone else
75.45: to be able to read this
message such as Eve.
78.095: Just as an example we'll keep
the message really simple.
81.11: Alice will need to scramble
the contents of the message.
84.662: This is called encryption.
87.45: It looks like a bunch of random letters
89.27: and if Eve gets a hold of
it then she won't be able
91.53: to understand it.
93.16: When the message gets to Bob he needs
95.25: to unscramble the message.
96.92: This is called decryption.
98.702: Now he can read the original message.
100.973: Alice and Bob need to agree on a way
102.956: to encrypt and decrypt their messages.
105.87: A real simple way to do this
is called a Caesar cipher.
108.723: This involves shifting all
the letters in the message
112.04: three spaces to the right in the alphabet
114.27: so an H becomes a K, an E becomes an H,
118.367: an L becomes an O, an L becomes another O,
122.387: and an O becomes an R.
125.2: Now the message looks like gibberish,
127.26: A bunch of random letters.
129.2: When Bob gets the message all he has to do
131.51: is take each letter and
move it back three spaces.
135.26: This will give him the original message
137.16: so he can read it again.
139.01: Now Eve in the middle, as
long as she doesn't know
141.59: how the messages were encrypted
143.44: she won't be able to read any one of them.
146.72: During war encryption
is extremely important.
149.9: Commanding officers need to
be able to get messages out
152.28: to the troops on the battlefield
153.66: but they don't want the enemy to be able
155.15: to understand these messages.
157.572: Nowadays encryption is
performed by computers
160.693: but this wasn't always the case.
163.3: The Enigma machine was used to
encrypt and decrypt messages.
167.026: You can think of this
as a very sophisticated
169.54: letter scrambler.
171.01: It was invented in the early 1900s
172.646: and then most famously, it was used
175.09: by the German military in the 1930s
177.6: and throughout World War II.
182.04: This is the keyboard with 26 letters.
185.264: And this is the lamp board
which also has 26 letters
189.38: but these letters can light up.
191.97: Each time you press a
letter on the keyboard,
194.13: a letter on the lamp board lights up,
196.57: but it will always be a different letter
198.45: than the one that was pressed.
200.5: There are usually two people involved
202.32: when the machine is used, one
person to type in the letters
204.894: and another person to
write down the letters
207.26: that appear on the lamp board.
209.54: Let's use our example from earlier.
211.243: Type in each letter and
write down the letters
214.48: that appear on the lamp board.
216.55: Now we have our encrypted message,
218.45: the scrambled letters
that nobody can read.
220.83: This message is sent usually
by radio using morse code.
224.29: The person who receives this message also
226.61: has their own Enigma machine.
228.74: To decrypt the message or unscramble it
231.14: they type in the letters on the keyboard
232.7: and write down which letters appear
234.49: on the lamp board and out
comes the original message.
237.94: The Enigma machine was used for both
240.51: encryption and decryption.
243.102: The person sending the
message needs a machine
245.88: and the person receiving the message
247.327: also needs a machine to
be able to read it again.
251.06: So how does the Enigma
machine know which letters
253.44: to give you?
254.64: Maybe you press an A and outcomes an H.
258.09: How does it do that?
260.13: Well, part of the answer is electricity.
262.7: Let me show you a simple example.
265.12: We have a battery, some
wires, and then something
268.0: that uses electricity in
this case, a light bulb.
271.43: This is called a circuit.
272.63: It's a closed loop for
the electricity to flow.
275.92: But if there's a break in the wire,
277.25: then the light bulb turns off.
279.66: If we put a switch in here,
now we can easily turn
282.16: the light bulb on or off.
284.34: There has to be a complete path
for the electricity to flow.
288.28: Now let's add another
path, one more switch,
290.83: and a light bulb.
291.89: Now we can turn on two
different light bulbs
294.22: depending on which switch we turn on,
296.17: there's a different
path through the wires.
298.538: We could expand this even more,
300.721: more switches and more light bulbs.
303.327: Now, this is predictable.
305.48: We know which switch
goes to which light bulb,
308.68: but what if we scramble these wires?
311.31: Now the switch for the letter A turns on
313.67: the letter C light bulb and the C switch
315.871: turns on the B light bulb.
318.495: This idea of scrambling the wires,
321.125: that's how the Enigma machine works.
324.12: Let me show you on the real thing.
326.29: The battery is inside in
the top right-hand corner
329.53: of the machine.
331.04: The keyboard has 26 keys.
333.8: When you press one of
them it connects a circuit
336.01: which will then turn on one
of these 26 light bulbs.
340.04: The light bulbs will then
illuminate the letter
342.01: that's directly above
it on the lamp board.
344.33: When you release the key, the circuit
346.3: is disconnected and the
light bulb turns off.
349.54: Each key connects a different path
351.42: which means a different light bulb.
353.61: Okay, this is the
challenging part of the video
356.46: understanding the circuit or the path
358.67: that the electricity follows
throughout the Enigma machine.
361.92: Maybe pause the video, get your degree
363.57: in electrical engineering
and then let's do this.
367.07: The three main parts that
we need to understand
369.36: are the rotors, the keyboard
mechanism, and the plugboard.
375.9: Let's start up here with the rotors.
377.82: This machine has three of them.
379.94: This is where the letters get scrambled.
382.62: Let's take a look at one of the rotors.
384.327: You have the numbers one
through 26 for all the letters.
388.21: So one is for A, two is
for B, three is for C
391.924: and all the way around until 26 for Z.
396.71: On the side you'll see
26 metal contact points.
399.47: There are also 26 on the other side too.
404.12: When you put two of these rotors together
406.03: the metal contacts
connect, making it possible
408.58: for electricity to pass through.
411.07: On the inside of these three rotors
412.79: you'll find lots of wires
that connects the two sides,
415.68: but as you can see, it's all scrambled.
418.49: So let's go through the
pin for the number one.
421.78: Follow the wire through
and it comes out the pin
426.25: for the number four.
428.17: So in this case an A was changed to a D.
431.739: When electricity travels through one rotor
434.29: it changes the letter once.
435.75: But remember, we have
three of these rotors
438.08: and they each have different
wirings on the inside.
441.46: When electricity travels
through all three of them
444.21: it changes the letter three times.
446.832: Then at the end, we have the reflector.
450.78: This also has 26 metal contacts.
454.276: Inside is more wiring that
connects the letters in pairs.
458.89: So it goes in as one
letter and then comes out
461.74: as another letter.
464.11: To the right of here is the input wheel.
466.756: It has 26 wires that go in and connects
469.79: to the 26 metal contacts.
473.36: Let's put this all together.
474.98: Electricity flows through
one of the 26 wires,
477.699: let's say the wire for the letter Y.
480.7: Then it gets changed to a different letter
482.67: at all three rotors.
484.48: Then it hits the reflector,
which again, changes the letter.
487.527: And then it goes back
through the rotors again
489.615: which changes the letter three more times.
492.57: And it comes back out on
a wire that represents
494.62: a completely different letter.
496.75: And if you were counting,
this means the letter
498.97: was changed seven times.
501.819: Now, this is just an
example of how the letters
504.3: could get scrambled, but the
path can and will change.
510.1: Each of these three rotors can rotate
511.85: to 26 different positions.
514.03: When any one of the
rotors changes positions
515.943: this will also change
the path of electricity
518.98: making it very difficult
to predict which letters
521.77: are going to come out.
525.64: The 26 wires from the input
will travel down the right side
528.98: of the machine to the
plugboard in the very front.
532.07: Now the plugboard was yet another way
534.05: that the letters could
be around specifically,
536.299: you could swap two letters.
537.981: So let's say we wanna
switch the W and the J.
541.533: You could take one of these cables here
543.93: with plugs at each end and put
one of them into the W spot
547.389: and the other one in the J spot.
550.464: On the back side of the plugboard,
552.09: you can see the individual wires going
554.49: to the tops of each socket,
and then out to the bottom
557.76: of each socket.
559.26: Let's take a closer look.
560.73: This is the plugboard
socket for the letter O.
563.93: If nothing is plugged into
it the electricity flows in
566.239: through the top, then
through the shorting bar
570.25: and then out through the bottom.
572.18: This means that the plugboard
didn't change the letter.
574.7: It came in as the letter
O and then it came out
576.91: as the letter O.
578.48: When a plug is inserted, it
pushes up the shorting bar
581.024: so it doesn't connect anymore.
583.83: Now the electricity
flows in through the top,
586.158: out through the top pin of the plug,
589.0: then through the cable and
out through the bottom.
592.19: On the other side.
593.86: What came in as an O now
it comes out as an E.
599.47: Often times, they would use
up to 10 of these cables.
603.16: Notice how a few of these
letters are still left
605.46: without a plug.
609.16: Let's take a look at
the keyboard mechanism.
611.75: Each of these keys is connected
to a long stem beneath it.
615.57: They have springs that push them back up
617.37: when you release the key.
619.21: the last row of keys have the
springs connected at the top.
623.071: Right next to all of these keys
625.24: most of the space is taken up.
627.58: These are the 26 key switches.
630.92: These switches are a
little bit more complex
632.93: than just the on-off
switches that we saw earlier.
635.43: Let's take a look at
just one of the switches.
637.39: This one is for the letter P.
639.43: The switch has three
different copper colored tabs.
642.589: The wires are connected back here,
645.459: and the flow of electricity is controlled
647.98: from the other end.
649.53: When a key is pressed it comes down
651.63: and hits the rubber end of the middle tab.
653.91: What this does is changes
where the electricity can flow.
657.267: Before a key is pressed the
top two tabs are connected,
660.725: and after the key is pressed, the bottom
663.82: two tabs are connected.
666.182: There are 26 key switches
and here's all the wires
671.44: that are connected to them.
673.18: The top tabs are connected
to the light bulbs.
676.07: The wires go to the left
and up to the corresponding
679.89: 26 light bulbs.
684.86: The middle tabs connect to the plugboard.
687.73: They go through the wires to
the right side of the machine
690.386: and down to the corresponding
letters on the plugboard.
695.82: A wire from the battery goes directly
697.89: into the bottom tabs of each key switch.
702.25: So each switch has three different tabs
704.991: and three different places
where they are connected to.
709.63: Before a key is pressed the bottom tab
711.85: isn't connected to
anything so the electricity
713.942: has nowhere to go.
715.92: This is true for all 26 key switches.
719.35: No circuit, which means all
the light bulbs are off.
723.46: Now let's say we press the X key.
727.56: The battery and the
plugboard are now connected.
729.94: This completes a circuit
but it's not as simple
732.57: as this circuit we saw earlier.
735.01: Let me show you a quick overview
of the path of electricity.
738.32: Don't worry if you
can't keep up quite yet,
740.17: we're gonna go over each part one by one.
743.258: (mellow music)
748.72: Let's take a closer look at each step.
751.41: Electricity flows from
the battery to the bottom
754.62: and then middle tab on the
switch for the letter X.
758.07: Then it goes directly to the plugboard.
762.574: And in this case there's
nothing plugged in
764.07: for the letter X so it comes
back out as the letter X,
767.98: up the side and into the input wheel.
770.94: Then through three rotors, the reflector,
773.81: and then back through the rotors again,
775.97: changing letters at each step of the way.
778.38: What started as the letter
X is now the letter K.
783.78: Now we come back to the
plugboard for the second time.
786.87: The letter K is swapped with a C.
790.75: So in through the letter
K, through the cord,
794.95: and then out for the letter C.
797.59: Then travels from the plugboard back
799.45: to the middle tab on
the letter C key switch.
802.5: Remember we started as the letter X
805.27: but then came back in as the letter C.
809.02: Then it goes out the wire of the top tab
811.338: and up to the letter C light bulb.
816.34: Then the current flows through
the metal light bulb plate
819.604: to this tiny wire which
connects back to the battery.
823.59: This completes our circuit.
825.95: As soon as the key is
released no more circuit
828.32: and the light bulb turns off.
830.78: So just to recap, once a key is pressed
833.61: electricity goes from the battery
835.7: to whichever key switch was pressed.
838.26: Then the plugboard, rotors,
then back to the plugboard,
842.839: then the key switch for
our new scrambled letter,
845.935: then the corresponding light bulb
848.66: and then back to the battery.
850.74: The letter has changed
seven times at the rotors,
854.895: and then possibly two more
times at the plugboard.
860.74: Remember that the letter
isn't always changed
863.08: when it goes to the plugboard.
868.3: Okay, the electric circuit was
the hard part of the video.
871.27: If you made it this far, we're doing good,
873.23: but there's a little bit
more that I wanna show you.
878.31: Each time a key is pressed
you'll notice that at least one
880.689: of these three rotors will turn.
883.49: Press a key rotor turns,
press a key rotor turns.
888.22: This means that if you press a key twice
889.748: you'll get two different letters.
892.83: In fact, if you keep
pressing the same letter
895.4: a different light turns on every time.
898.14: This is what made Enigma so powerful.
900.33: The code was always changing
so it was hard to predict
902.9: which letters were going to come out.
905.24: The way these rotor spin
is completely mechanical.
907.88: No electricity needed for this.
909.65: Even if the battery was taken out,
911.35: pressing one of these keys
would still turn the rotor.
914.61: On the bottom of the machine
is a large metal plate
917.08: called the actuator bar.
919.275: It works like a seesaw or a teeter-totter.
923.38: Pressing any of the keys
pushes it down on this side,
926.54: which pushes it up on the other side.
929.77: Around the backside is
where the magic happens.
934.581: This uses a ratchet and pawl mechanism.
938.51: This is the ratchet gear.
940.258: And this small piece is the pawl.
943.867: When the pawl is pushed
up it spins the rotor
946.42: and then comes back down.
948.26: You can see how this would
spin it in only one direction.
951.64: This up and down motion will
keep spinning the rotors
954.07: one slot each time.
956.25: The next two rotors
work a little different.
958.71: Let's take a look at the second one.
960.5: Most of the time the
pawl can't make contact
962.75: with the ratchet gear teeth.
964.96: It's blocked by an edge around
here on the first rotor.
967.971: The first rotor has a tiny
notch around the side here.
972.05: When the rotor spins the
notch travels around the edge.
975.88: Watch what happens when it comes up again
977.76: on the other side.
979.24: The pawl will fit right into the notch
981.15: and the second rotor is
allowed to spin, but just once.
984.84: The next time it will be blocked again
986.58: and only the first rotor
is allowed to spin.
989.69: That edge on the first
rotor has to go all the way
992.21: around before the second rotor
is allowed to spin again.
995.05: This will happen once
every 26 key presses.
998.49: The same thing with the third rotor.
1000.68: There's another edge on the second rotor
1002.3: that has to go all the way around
1003.91: before the third one is allowed to spin.
1006.974: Last but not least we
have the three levers
1010.45: on the very back with index
wheels at the very end.
1014.22: They ride along the outside
of the rotor gear teeth.
1017.2: This means that the rotors
always stop spinning
1019.69: at the next number.
1020.72: This is important so that
the electrical contacts
1022.776: always line up between the rotors.
1027.51: Before you use the Enigma machine,
1029.5: it would need to be configured
with the right settings.
1032.31: There are four of these
settings to go through.
1036.88: First is the rotor order.
1038.92: Each Enigma machine came
with a set of five rotors.
1041.628: Choose three of them and
then choose which order
1045.81: to put them in.
1047.36: Then there's the ring
setting for each rotor
1049.69: which is basically the
shifting of these number wheels
1052.54: but that also includes
the notch on the side.
1057.4: This means this will change
when the leftmost rotors
1060.04: can be advanced to the next number.
1062.98: Then there's the starting
position for each rotor.
1065.53: You can set this to the
tiny windows up here.
1070.0: And the final setting is the configuration
1072.29: of the plugboard at the very front.
1076.5: So everyone in the German
army had these settings
1079.11: in advance.
1080.0: They were distributed out by paper
1081.61: so they would know
which settings to use
1083.34: on which day of the month.
1085.62: Even if the opposing side
has their own Enigma machine,
1088.725: they won't be able to read the messages
1090.89: unless they know the settings
that were in use that day.
1094.37: Some of the ideas behind
the Enigma machine
1096.302: are complex and sometimes
difficult to understand.
1099.98: However, it may come easier to those
1101.75: that increase their ability
to do math and science.
1105.18: brilliant.org is a problem solving website
1107.47: and app that has over 60
courses in mathematics,
1110.848: science and computer science.
1113.98: The idea here is to learn by doing.
1115.829: They teach you a concept and
